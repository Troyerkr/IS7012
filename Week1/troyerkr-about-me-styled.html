                        <p>Growing up I was an early adoptor of podcasts and I always liked to listen to something while doing something else. 
                            Since the start of my sophmore year of college I added Audiobooks to my weekly rotation of podcasts and music. 
                            I am including a link to a book I listened to over summer break by Michael Lewis (of <u>Moneyball</u> and <u>Big Short</u> fame) 
                            called <u>The Premonition</u>. The book is about the team that created the United States' pandemic preparedness plan and how they tried to help with the COVID-19 pandemic without being in a position of power. 
                            I reccomend it but is definitely a frustrating read.

                        <p>I have always been a big fan of music, both listening and making. 
                            I did choir throughout my gradeschool and highschool and last spring I started to learn guitar.
                            I included a link to my apple music yearly playlist which is generated from the music that listened to in a given year, in this case the year 2019.
